First and foremost, changed server.js to app.js because I have added a server folder to the root. 
Now it can work with npm start if you so choose.
 I still use nodemon app.js.

Got the beginning of Mongo set up. Now you must log in as one of the five users in the Express.js file.
I use Mongoose and MongoDB for the database and Passport for the authentication.
You also must start up Mongo for this project to work.


Added a new folder called server to the root. Added a couple of server-side javascript files to the folder.
